# wireCalculatorAC
This calculator sizes conductors for AC circuits 2,000V or less.

Minimum conductor sizes based on NEC article 310, grounding based on NEC article 250, and AC impedance sourced from modified NEC chapter 9 table 9 for voltage drop.

Please double check all answers, this is still in testing phase. Don’t cross check this with Southwire’s calculator because their calcultor incorrectly assumes aluminum wire is in aluminum conduit and copper wire is in steel conduit. Please cross check by hand.
